# Churn Prediction Project for the Telecom Industry

Welcome to the Churn Prediction Project repository for the Telecom Industry. This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom sector using various data analysis and machine learning techniques. This README file provides an overview of the project, its contents, and how to navigate the repository.

## Project Overview

In the fast-paced and competitive telecommunications industry, retaining customers is crucial for business success. Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers leaving a service provider for various reasons, is a significant concern. This project addresses this issue by developing predictive models to identify potential churners and implementing strategies to reduce churn rates.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following key components:

1. Data: The `data` directory contains the dataset used for this project. It includes customer information, contract details, internet service specifics, and churn labels.

2. Notebooks: The `notebooks` directory includes Jupyter notebooks that document the data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation processes. These notebooks are named in a logical sequence for easy comprehension.

3. Scripts: The `scripts` directory contains any utility scripts or code used in the project. These scripts may include data preprocessing, model training, or other functions necessary for the analysis.

4. Reports: The `reports` directory stores project reports, summaries, or presentations that showcase the findings, insights, and results of the churn prediction model.

5. Models: If applicable, this directory holds serialized machine learning models that were developed and trained for churn prediction.

6. README.md: You are currently reading the README file, which serves as the primary documentation for this repository.
